embedded zookeeper.

goals: a zookeeper embedded in application instance, like embedded tomcat.

design:
1, secure. the application instance can connect local embedded zookeeper. so the security between application and embedded
zookeeper can be ignored.
2, for simple. one application instance only connect local embedded zookeeper.


3, configuration
 zookeeper.serverCnxnFactory = org.apache.zookeeper.server.cnxn.embedded.EmbeddedServerCnxnFactory
